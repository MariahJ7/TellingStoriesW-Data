# TellingStoriesW-Data
This is my public portfolio for the CMU course "Telling Stories with Data."

# About Me
I am a graduate student in the abovementioned course pursuing a MBA and a MS in Healthcare Policy and Management. I am in my second year at CMU and use pronouns she/her. I define myself as a problem solver in the healthcare space and want to increasingly use quantiative data where possible in order to affect change in the organizations in which I work. I have worked in healthcare for the past 5.5 years in the area of biomedical research administration and more recently in the area of healthcare insurance. Post graduation I plan to consult in the healthcare insurance market or participate in a leadership development program at a healthcare insurance company. 

# What I hope to learn
I want to complement my data analysis skills with an understanding of how best to depict findings and insights in a visual way. I have been reluctant to be creative with visual representations in the past but want to hone that skill as I reenter the workforce in fall 2020.
