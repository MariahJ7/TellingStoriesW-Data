# Outline 
High Level Project Summary 

The project focuses on the trend of "Aging in Place". I will use New York City as a case study to show what aids seniors in their ability to age in placed and what can be improved on within NYC specifically to make this movement more widespread. The purpose of this project is to convey how findings here could be applied to the decision making process around where a senior should age and for city planning and continuous improvement more broadly.
