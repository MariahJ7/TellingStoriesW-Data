High Level Project Summary 

The project focuses on the trend of "Aging in Place". I will use New York City as a case study to show what aids seniors in their ability to age in placed and what can be improved on within NYC specifically to make this movement more widespread. The purpose of this project is to convey how findings here could be applied to the decision making process around where a senior should age and for city planning and continuous improvement more broadly.  

Project Structure 

1. Inspiration: Having lived in NYC for 5.5 years before CMU and watching my grandma move into assisted living and then a nursing home in Westchester, NY due to NYC, I have wondered about aging and where seniors are best suited for living the later years of their lives. 
2. What do seniors want: This site talks about what is important to seniors as they age: 
3. What do people need to survive: Review of Maslow's Hiearchy of needs for driving what seniors need to have high life satisfaction. Here is a reference to that chart: https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html
4. How does NYC meet or not meet these needs:
5. Barriers to change: I will share data that suggests that seniors are not as tech saavy which impacts their ability to take advantage of services within the city that have been created to handle convenience. They may also be limited by their income and the funding mechanisms (ex. Social Security and Medicaid) which dictate how they can spend their funds. 
6. Ideas for future cities:
