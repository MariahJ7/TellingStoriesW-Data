# PART 1: Outline 
High Level Project Summary 

The project focuses on the trend of "Aging in Place". I will use New York City as a case study to show what aids seniors in their ability to age in placed and what can be improved on within NYC specifically to make this movement more widespread. The purpose of this project is to convey how findings here could be applied to the decision making process around where a senior should age and for city planning and continuous improvement more broadly.  

Project Structure 

1. Inspiration: Having lived in NYC for 5.5 years before CMU and watching my grandma move into assisted living and then a nursing home in Westchester, I have wondered about aging and where seniors are best suited for living the later years of their lives. 
2. What do seniors want: I will share data that addresses what is important to seniors as they age.
3. What do people need to survive: Review of Maslow's Hiearchy of needs for driving what seniors need to have high life satisfaction. Here is a reference to that chart: https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html
4. How does NYC meet or not meet these needs: I will look at this from the perspective of community centers. If I can find additional data on safety, affordability and walkability indexes, I will incorporate that. 
5. Barriers to change: I will share data that suggests that seniors are not as tech saavy which impacts their ability to take advantage of services within the city that have been created to handle convenience. They may also be limited by their income and the funding mechanisms (ex. Social Security and Medicaid) which dictate how they can spend their funds. 
6. Ideas for future cities: This will center around the use of community centers and what they can offer to get seniors in a good place to living on their own. 

# Initial Sketches

Inspiration: a photo of seniors navigating NYC like this found on google: https://www.flickr.com/photos/91238497@N06/8942568164
What do seniors want: I would include this graph or a remake of it: https://www.statista.com/statistics/895216/valuable-services-features-for-seniors-north-america/
What do people need to survive: I would draw the chart and focus on certain areas of it by drawing a box around them so its clear what we are focusing on in the story. 
How Does NYC meet or not meet these needs: I would vizualize data here on community centers and how many there are per seniors in a given region of nyc for understanding if they have an impact on seniors. 
Barriers to change: this will have images related to technology and possible graphs that indicate seniors impressions of technology. 
Ideas for future cities: this will likely be a list of action items for cities.

# The Data 
I will be using several data sources to tell the story. Here are the data sources associated with the different parts of the assignment: 

What do seniors want: https://www.statista.com/statistics/895216/valuable-services-features-for-seniors-north-america/, https://www.statista.com/statistics/895026/future-moving-plans-when-elderly-north-america-by-city/, https://www.statista.com/statistics/733846/us-senior-usage-social-media-by-age-group/
How does NYC meet or not meet these needs: I will use these data sets to look at the prevalence of community centers in the NYC area given that seniors still are not the heaviest tech users and can benefit from receiving information on services through a site near them. Also sites serve as good places for seniors to have interaction. I will analyze these two data sets: https://data.ny.gov/Human-Services/Directory-of-Multi-Purpose-Senior-Centers/t4ba-giyx and https://data.ny.gov/Human-Services/Directory-of-Aging-and-Disability-Community-Resour/jwv3-3scj/data. 
Barriers to change: https://www.statista.com/statistics/733811/us-percentage-of-senior-smartphone-and-cell-phone-owners-by-age-group/, https://www.statista.com/statistics/709191/percentage-of-senior-internet-users-by-age-groups-in-the-us/

# Method and Medium
The story will be told on Shorthand. I like that platform for this work as its vivid, captures the audiences attention and can communicate a sequential story well. I have several graphs that I can use directly from Statistica and others I will need to do more analysis on but in general, I feel that Shorthand will be a good place to display images and graphs within the story.
