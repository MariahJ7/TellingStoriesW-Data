# Part 3: The Final Deliverable

This project has developed into something quite different than what was imagined initially. The final project can be found [here:](/ https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/improvingseniorlivabilityinnyc/index.html) Thinking back to [Part 1](/finalprojectdev.md) and [Part 2](/finalprojectpart2.md), as I worked on Part 3, it became clear who the audience of the work should be and what it would take to deliver a message to them. In this section I will go through a description of the intended audience and the work that was completed to get to this place.
